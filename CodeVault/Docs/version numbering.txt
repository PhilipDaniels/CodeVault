Major.Minor.Build.Revision

Build = a compilation
Revision = a sub-compilation, eg if we had to build
  twice in one day when we normally do it once per day

See Richter p57 for the difference between the 3 different
version numbers.

[assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")]   <<<< this is the important one
[assembly: AssemblyInformationalVersion("1.0.0.0")]   <<<< for info
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]    <<<< for info

You should set AssemblyVersion by hand when you create a new assembly
or a new version of the assembly.
