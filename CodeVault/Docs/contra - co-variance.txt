Delegates
=========
Covariance: a method can return a type derived from the	delegate's return type
Contravariance: A method can take a parameter that is a base of	the delegate's parameter type

eg given a delegate

	delegate object MyCallback(FileStream s);

this is a legal delegate

	string SomeMethod(Stream s);

Contra- and co-variance are only supported for reference types.
